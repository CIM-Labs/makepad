# Makepad

## Overview
 
This is the repository for Makepad, a new way to build UIs in Rust for both native and the web.

Makepad consists of Makepad Framework and Makepad Studio.

Makepad Framework is our UI framework. It consists of multiple crates, but the top level crate is [makepad-widgets](https://crates.io/crates/makepad-widgets). For a further explanation of Makepad Framework, please see the README for that crate.

Makepad Studio is a prototype of an IDE that we've built using Makepad Framework. It's still under heavy development, but our eventual goal with Makepad Studio is to create an IDE that enables the design of an application to be changed at runtime. The main crate for Makepad Studio is [makepad-studio](https://crates.io/crates/makepad-studio). Please see the README for that crate for more.

### Prerequisites

To build the Makepad crates you first need to install Rust.
[https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

Our native builds work on the stable Rust toolchain. However, some of the errors generated by Makepad at runtime (particulary those originating in our DSL) do not contain line information unless you use the nightly Rust toolchain. Moreover, our web builds only work on nightly for now. For this reason, we recommend that you build Makepad using the nightly Rust toolchain.

For the non standard build targets (ios, android, wasm) we have a buildtool called 'cargo-makepad' that you need to install.

Install it from the repo:
```cargo install --path=./tools/cargo_makepad```
Or install it from cargo (might be behind the repo)
```cargo install cargo-makepad```

Now this tool can be used to install toolchains per platform needed
```cargo makepad wasm install-toolchain```
```cargo makepad ios install-toolchain```
```cargo makepad android install-toolchain```

## Running makepad studio

Makepad studio allows you to easily build and view the examples, and it uses cargo-makepad internally so be sure to install it.

```cargo run -p makepad-studio --release```

If you build the wasm applications, you can open it on:
http://127.0.0.1:8001/examples/ironfish/src/index.html
http://127.0.0.1:8001/examples/fractal_zoom/src/index.html
http://127.0.0.1:8001/examples/simple/src/index.html
http://127.0.0.1:8001/examples/news_feed/src/index.html

```cargo run -p makepad-studio --release```
