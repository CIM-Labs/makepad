# TODO

## General

- moving window by dragging titlebar is incorrect (only left part of bar works)
- cursor updates

## Client Process

- call studio update after texture has changed

## Drag/Drop

* pass modifier keys from IDropTarget_Impl to win32_window
- press mouse up after a drag ends
* implement drag/drop item interface
+ drag text file onto makepad
- drag file from makepad to desktop
+ indicate to windows when a drop can be done or not, so the cursor can change
- update cursor to indicate copy/move/link operation
